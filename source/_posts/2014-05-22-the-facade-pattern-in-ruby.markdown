A few months ago I started implementing a pattern that I picked up from some fellow [Nerds](http://www.bignerdranch.com). I sort of blindly used it, not taking the time to figure out why I liked it so much (and not even knowing it had a name) until [Charlie](https://twitter.com/charliebomber) pressed me for the big question: "great, but why?"

Turns out, it does have a name (duh), and that name is the [facade pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern).
