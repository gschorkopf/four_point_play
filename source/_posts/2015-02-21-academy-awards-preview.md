My prognostications for the major Academy Awards.

<!--more-->

####Best Supporting Actor

Nominees - Robert Duvall (*The Judge*), Ethan Hawke (*Boyhood*), Edward Norton (*Birdman*), Mark Ruffalo (*Foxcatcher*), J.K. Simmons (*Whiplash*)

Should win - **J.K. Simmons**

Will win - **J.K. Simmons**

Not having seen this film until after my Oscars post, I am in elation that it is up for a few awards and receiving recognition. So many positives to talk about - evocative editing, a tight screenplay, and Miles Teller's stupendous drumming skills. And, of course, J.K. Simmons is chilling as the abusive conservatory conductor that cruelly manipulates his disciple. Oh, remember how in the beginning Miles Teller's character asks out the movie theater clerk... I've always wanted to do that.

####Best Supporting Actress
Nominees - Patricia Arquette (*Boyhood*), Laura Dern (*Wild*), Keira Knightley (*The Imitation Game*), Emma Stone (*Birdman*), Meryl Streep (*Into The Woods*)

Should win - **Patricia Arquette**

Will win - **Patricia Arquette**

I haven't seen most of the films in this category, but Arquette has won the SAG, BAFTA (UK Oscars), and GG. Her performance culminates in a speech to Mason as he packs for college - she thought there would me more. It is so heartwrenching after witnessing all her tribulations with abusive husbands to see a mom want more time with her son. Or think that the time would have meant something more. I remember my mom feeling the same way when I went off to college, and I'm sure the feeling of separation is univeral among [all moms](http://www.hiphopearly.com/Drake-You-The-6-t27119.html).

####Best Adapted Screenplay
Nominees - *American Sniper*, *The Imitation Game*, *Inherent Vice*, *The Theory of Everything*, *Whiplash*

Should win - **_Inherent Vice_**

Will win - **_The Imitation Game_**

What I've been hearing on the interwebs is that the Weinstein company has been pushing hard for *The Imitation Game* to at least win this category. As Harvey Weinstein desires, it shall be. But, adapting Thomas Pynchon's schizophrenic novel for the screen is no easy task. The work that P.T. Anderson and Pynchon put in to make *Inherent Vice's* narrative evoke the themes and style of the book is worthy of an Oscar here.

####Best Original Screenplay
Nominees - *Birdman*, *Boyhood*, *Foxcatcher*, *The Grand Budapest Hotel*, *Nightcrawler*

Should win - ***The Grand Budapest Hotel***

Will win - ***The Grand Budapest Hotel***

If you don't remember, *The Grand Budapest Hotel's* narrative structure is as follows - a young woman visits the grave of a famous author who wrote a story called *The Grand Budapest Hotel*, we cut to the author reminiscing about the story, we flashback again to when the younger author met an older Zero Moustafa who told him the story, and then we go back once more to the time that the events were taking place. This is no easy feat.  Not to mention the precise dialogue and mannerisms of M. Gustave and the supporting cast. I love this movie [(and so does this guy)](https://vimeo.com/119754714). Wes Anderson deserves this award in spades.

####Best Animated Film
Nominees - *Big Hero 6*, *The Boxtrolls*, *How To Train Your Dragon 2*, *Song Of The Sea*, *The Tale Of The Princess Kaguya*

Should win - ***The Lego Movie*** (not nominated)

Will win - ***How To Train Your Dragon 2***

*The Lego Movie* was robbed of a nomination here. No matter, it lends some purity to its legacy. One of the directors, Phil Lord, had the [perfect response](https://twitter.com/philiplord/status/555729488164569089).

####Best Actor
Nominees - Steve Carell (*Foxcatcher*), Bradley Cooper (*American Sniper*), Benedictus Cumbersnoot (*The Imitation Game*), Michael Keaton (*Birdman*), Eddie Redmayne (*The Theory of Everything*)

Should win - **Ralph Fiennes** (*The Grand Budapest Hotel*), **Jake Gyllenhaal** (*Nightcrawler*), **Oscar Isaac** (*A Most Violent Year*), or **David Oyelowo** (*Selma*) (None nominated)

Will win - **Eddie Redmayne**

The Academy loves gimmicks - Tom Hanks for *Forrest Gump*, Dustin Hoffman for *Rain Man*. The Academy also loves rewarding people with what represents a lifetime achievement award for a more current release - Scorcese for *The Departed*. Eddie Redmayne has been on a roll, picking up awards for essentially playing a disease process (ALS). Michael Keaton is the most deserving in this category because it was an Oscar-worthy performance, he has been neglected by the Academy for a long time, and he was fucking Batman.

#####Best Actress
Nominees - Marion Cotillard (*Two Days, One Night*), Felicity Jones (*The Theory Of Everything*), Julianne Moore (*Still Alice*), Rosamund Pike (*Gone Girl*), Reese Witherspoon (*Wild*)

Should win - **Rosamund Pike** (actually **Scarlett Johansson** if she was nominated for *Under The Skin*)

Will win - **Julianne Moore**

I haven't seen *Still Alice*, but Julianne Moore is excellent in everything she's in, and she has won all the awards for this category, so it's going to her. Thing is, she is also playing a disease process here (Alzheimer's). I would much rather give this to Rosamund Pike whose performance centered *Gone Girl*. She captured the psychological intricacies of the character in every moment. She is really the remaining image in my mind when I think of *Gone Girl*. That and Ben Affleck's penis.

####Best Director
Nominees - Alejandro González Iñárritu (*Birdman*), Richard Linklater (*Boyhood*), Bennett Miller (*Foxcatcher*), Wes Anderson (*The Grand Budapest Hotel*), Morten Tyldum (*The Imitation Game*)

Who should win - **Ava DuVernay** for *Selma* (not nominated)

Who will win - **Richard Linkater**

I went to a Q & A with Richard Linklater when I was up in NYC. It was so cool! He's just as jovial and insightful in real life as I hoped he would be! Too bad my question was passed up for some other assholes at Apple SoHo who wouldn't know how to address a brick, much less a legendary director. Yeesh. Anyway, Iñárritu is the other favorite in this category, and he won the DGA, while Linklater won all the other awards. I hope the voters don't deny the vision and patience of the 12-year spectacle that is *Boyhood*.

####Best Picture
Nominees - *American Sniper*, *Birdman*, *Boyhood*, *The Grand Budapest Hotel*, *The Imitation Game*, *Selma*, *The Theory Of Everything*, *Whiplash*

Should win - ***Selma***

Will win - ***Boyhood***

All the Best Picture nominees this year are about white males, directed by white males, except one. *Selma*, directed by an African-American female, Ava DuVernay, only has 2 nominations at the Oscars this year as a result of the movie finishing late, and the screeners not getting to voters in time for the guild awards, preventing it from gaining any momentum on the awards circuit. Oh and it is also [being smeared](http://grantland.com/features/selma-oscars-academy-awards-historical-accuracy-controversy/) by anti-intellectuals for its portrayal of Lyndon B. Johnson.  The tone-deaf inanity of some people is infuriating.

The film is about the voting rights marches from Selma to Montegomery in 1965 led by MLK. It dives into the politics, strategy and practicality of the movement and it is never boring. The directing, dialogue, and cinematography is on point and David Oyelowo as MLK is on another level. On top of all that, it is the most important movie of last year in the wake of all the violence perpetrated against black people. There is a depressing irony of a movie about MLK being criticized of its portrayal of a white person. *Selma* was riveting, go watch it.
