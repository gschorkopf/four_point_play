Herein lies my quick thoughts on the pathetic Indiana Pacers team, and why I need them to lose game 6 to enjoy watching the rest of the playoffs.

<!--more-->

I grew up without much of a sporting interest in basketball, let alone a rooting interest in my home-town Nets and Knicks; ergo, my passion for the sport extends to a love of most teams, and a general appreciation for fundamental, tough, skilled basketball.

In short: I want the clown car that drops the Pacers team off at American Airlines arena tomorrow to blow a tire and go careening off into South Beach. I need this bush-league playoff run to end.

I wanted it to end against the Hawks. I expected it to end against the Wizards. And now I <strong>need</strong> it to end against the Heat. Here's why.

<b>The driver of the clown car: Frank Vogel.</b> It's hard to watch, frankly. This is what I mean by pathetic - pathos. I feel bad for the guy. He's in way over his head, and is barely keeping the show on the road. When George, Hibbert, and Stephenson talk to the media or fall apart on the court, it's clearly a reflection on the coach, his style, and the respect he commands.

<b>Paul George's immaturity.</b> His 31 in the second half of game 5 was great. Does anyone expect him to repeat that? He's been hailed as a superstar this year. He's not. He's been hailed as their centerpiece, but he hardly brings the playoff room together. And his childish comments that the "refs affected game 4's outcome"? Did the refs blow you out by 12 points in a game that was never even that close? No. That was the Heat.

<b>Lance Stephenson's trash talk.</b> Really? You're going to sit there as the "occasionally 3rd best player" on a team and try to get in the best player <b>in the league's</b> head? Two losses later I thought he'd back down. But no: in game 5 he <b>blew in James' ear before a foul shot</b>. I know some basketball players didn't go to college, but surely y'all have graduated middle school, the very <b>last</b> time that stunt was socially acceptable. At least you've inspired some great [memes](http://espn.go.com/sportsnation/post/_/id/11001550/lance-stephenson-blows-lebron-ear-sparks-funny-memes), Lance.

In short: finish 'em off, Heat. The first-seed Pacers are barely the sixth seed in Western Conference. Their brash childishness must be stopped. I'd hate to watch a Pacers-versus <b>anyone</b> final. If they're going to act petulant, out-of-their-league, and frankly painful-to-watch, count me out. That's just the basketball fan in me.
