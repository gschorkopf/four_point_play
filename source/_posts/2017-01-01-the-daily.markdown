2016. Trump. Cruz and his booger. Justice for a gorilla. Shooting in Orlando. Attack in Nice.  Death of David Bowie. Death of Muhammad Ali. Death of [Prince symbol]. Death of [insert name here].

But at least a girl named [Jenna] wants a little of my time.

It's 2017. And I am going to make it through this year, if it kills me.
