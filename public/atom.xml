    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My prognostications for the major Academy Awards.</p>

<p><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ag3cbBzudsM/VLvfgGWe7uI/AAAAAAAASig/MnXRsLeh-m4/s1600/J.K.%2BSimmons%2BWhiplash.PNG" title="Not quite my tempo" alt="alt text" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Best Supporting Actor</h2>

<p>Nominees &ndash; Robert Duvall (<em>The Judge</em>), Ethan Hawke (<em>Boyhood</em>), Edward Norton (<em>Birdman</em>), Mark Ruffalo (<em>Foxcatcher</em>), J.K. Simmons (<em>Whiplash</em>)</p>

<p>Should win &ndash; <strong>J.K. Simmons</strong></p>

<p>Will win &ndash; <strong>J.K. Simmons</strong></p>

<p>Not having seen this film until after my Oscars post, I am in elation that it is up for a few awards and receiving recognition. So many positives to talk about &ndash; evocative editing, a tight screenplay, and Miles Teller&rsquo;s stupendous drumming skills. And, of course, J.K. Simmons is chilling as the abusive conservatory conductor that cruelly manipulates his disciple. Oh, remember how in the beginning Miles Teller&rsquo;s character asks out the movie theater clerk&hellip; I&rsquo;ve always wanted to do that.</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="http://media1.onsugar.com/files/2014/07/02/018/n/1922283/53ec746af1a7bba0_pat2.xxxlarge.jpg" title="Awwwww" alt="alt text" /></p>

<h2>Best Supporting Actress</h2>

<p>Nominees &ndash; Patricia Arquette (Boyhood), Laura Dern (Wild), Keira Knightley (The Imitation Game), Emma Stone (Birdman), Meryl Streep (Into The Woods)</p>

<p>Should win &ndash; <strong>Patricia Arquette</strong></p>

<p>Will win &ndash; <strong>Patricia Arquette</strong></p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen most of the films in this category, but Arquette has won the SAG, BAFTA (UK Oscars), and GG. Her performance culminates in a speech to Mason as he packs for college &ndash; she thought there would be more. It is so heartwrenching after witnessing all her tribulations with abusive husbands to see a mom want more time with her son. Or think that the time would have meant something more. I remember my mom feeling the same way when I went off to college, and I&rsquo;m sure the feeling of separation is univeral among <a href="http://www.hiphopearly.com/Drake-You-The-6-t27119.html">all moms</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/inherent-vice-image-joaquin-phoenix-katherine-waterston-joanna-newsom.jpg" title="Ouija!" alt="alt text" /></p>

<h2>Best Adapted Screenplay</h2>

<p>Nominees &ndash; <em>American Sniper</em>, <em>The Imitation Game</em>, <em>Inherent Vice</em>, <em>The Theory of Everything</em>, <em>Whiplash</em></p>

<p>Should win &ndash; <strong><em>Inherent Vice</em></strong></p>

<p>Will win &ndash; <strong><em>The Imitation Game</em></strong></p>

<p>What I&rsquo;ve been hearing on the interwebs is that the Weinstein company has been pushing hard for <em>The Imitation Game</em> to at least win this category. As Harvey Weinstein desires, it shall be. But, adapting Thomas Pynchon&rsquo;s schizophrenic novel for the screen is no easy task. The work that P.T. Anderson and Pynchon put in to make <em>Inherent Vice&rsquo;s</em> narrative evoke the themes and style of the book is worthy of an Oscar here.</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="https://cdn2.thedissolve.com/features/464/fullwidth.e4b3e81c.JPG" title="Agatha &amp; Zero" alt="alt text" /></p>

<h2>Best Original Screenplay</h2>

<p>Nominees &ndash; <em>Birdman</em>, <em>Boyhood</em>, <em>Foxcatcher</em>, <em>The Grand Budapest Hotel</em>, <em>Nightcrawler</em></p>

<p>Should win &ndash; <strong><em>The Grand Budapest Hotel</em></strong></p>

<p>Will win &ndash; <strong><em>The Grand Budapest Hotel</em></strong></p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t remember, <em>The Grand Budapest Hotel&rsquo;s</em> narrative structure is as follows &ndash; a young woman visits the grave of a famous author who wrote a story called <em>The Grand Budapest Hotel</em>, we cut to the author reminiscing about the story, we flashback again to when the younger author met an older Zero Moustafa who told him the story, and then we go back once more to the time that the events were taking place. This is no easy feat.  Not to mention the precise dialogue and mannerisms of M. Gustave and the supporting cast. I love this movie <a href="https://vimeo.com/119754714">(and so does this guy)</a>. Wes Anderson deserves this award in spades.</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="http://www.northcoastjournal.com/imager/b/original/2489631/c58a/Filmland.jpg" title="Boo - fuck you Batman" alt="alt text" /></p>

<h2>Best Animated Film</h2>

<p>Nominees &ndash; <em>Big Hero 6</em>, <em>The Boxtrolls</em>, <em>How To Train Your Dragon 2</em>, <em>Song Of The Sea</em>, <em>The Tale Of The Princess Kaguya</em></p>

<p>Should win &ndash; <strong><em>The Lego Movie</em></strong> (not nominated)</p>

<p>Will win &ndash; <strong><em>How To Train Your Dragon 2</em></strong></p>

<p><em>The Lego Movie</em> was robbed of a nomination here. No matter, it lends some purity to its legacy. One of the directors, Phil Lord, had the <a href="https://twitter.com/philiplord/status/555729488164569089">perfect response</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2015/02/Theory_of_Everything/8ef785ca3.jpg" title="Who?" alt="alt text" /></p>

<h2>Best Actor</h2>

<p>Nominees &ndash; Steve Carell (<em>Foxcatcher</em>), Bradley Cooper (<em>American Sniper</em>), Benedictus Cumbersnoot (<em>The Imitation Game</em>), Michael Keaton (<em>Birdman</em>), Eddie Redmayne (<em>The Theory of Everything</em>)</p>

<p>Should win &ndash; <strong>Ralph Fiennes</strong> (<em>The Grand Budapest Hotel</em>), <strong>Jake Gyllenhaal</strong> (<em>Nightcrawler</em>), <strong>Oscar Isaac</strong> (<em>A Most Violent Year</em>), or <strong>David Oyelowo</strong> (<em>Selma</em>) (None nominated)</p>

<p>Will win &ndash; <strong>Eddie Redmayne</strong></p>

<p>The Academy loves gimmicks &ndash; Tom Hanks for <em>Forrest Gump</em>, Dustin Hoffman for <em>Rain Man</em>. The Academy also loves rewarding people with what represents a lifetime achievement award for a more current release &ndash; Scorcese for <em>The Departed</em>. Eddie Redmayne has been on a roll, picking up awards for essentially playing a disease process (ALS). Michael Keaton is the most deserving in this category because it was an Oscar-worthy performance, he has been neglected by the Academy for a long time, and he was fucking Batman.</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="http://moviemezzanine.com/wp-content/uploads/GONE-GIRL-Movie-HD-Trailer-Captures00004_1_11.jpg" title="So scary" alt="alt text" /></p>

<h2>Best Actress</h2>

<p>Nominees &ndash; Marion Cotillard (<em>Two Days, One Night</em>), Felicity Jones (<em>The Theory Of Everything</em>), Julianne Moore (<em>Still Alice</em>), Rosamund Pike (<em>Gone Girl</em>), Reese Witherspoon (<em>Wild</em>)</p>

<p>Should win &ndash; <strong>Rosamund Pike</strong> (actually <strong>Scarlett Johansson</strong> if she was nominated for <em>Under The Skin</em>)</p>

<p>Will win &ndash; <strong>Julianne Moore</strong></p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen <em>Still Alice</em>, but Julianne Moore is excellent in everything she&rsquo;s in, and she has won all the awards for this category, so it&rsquo;s going to her. Thing is, she is also playing a disease process here (Alzheimer&rsquo;s). I would much rather give this to Rosamund Pike whose performance centered <em>Gone Girl</em>. She captured the psychological intricacies of the character in every moment. She is really the remaining image in my mind when I think of <em>Gone Girl</em>. That and Ben Affleck&rsquo;s penis.</p>

<h2>Best Director</h2>

<p>Nominees &ndash; Alejandro González Iñárritu (Birdman), Richard Linklater (Boyhood), Bennett Miller (Foxcatcher), Wes Anderson (The Grand Budapest Hotel), Morten Tyldum (The Imitation Game)</p>

<p>Who should win &ndash; <strong>Ava DuVernay</strong> for <em>Selma</em> (not nominated)</p>

<p>Who will win &ndash; <strong>Richard Linkater</strong></p>

<p>I went to a Q &amp; A with Richard Linklater when I was up in NYC. It was so cool! He&rsquo;s just as jovial and insightful in real life as I hoped he would be! Too bad my question was passed up for some other assholes at Apple SoHo who wouldn&rsquo;t know how to address a brick, much less a legendary director. Yeesh. Anyway, Iñárritu is the other favorite in this category, and he won the DGA, while Linklater won all the other awards. I hope the voters don&rsquo;t deny the vision and patience of the 12-year spectacle that is <em>Boyhood</em>.</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="http://www.selmamovie.com/images/photos/10.jpg" title="MLK" alt="alt text" /></p>

<h2>Best Picture</h2>

<p>Nominees &ndash; <em>American Sniper</em>, <em>Birdman</em>, <em>Boyhood</em>, <em>The Grand Budapest Hotel</em>, <em>The Imitation Game</em>, <em>Selma</em>, <em>The Theory Of Everything</em>, <em>Whiplash</em></p>

<p>Should win &ndash; <strong><em>Selma</em></strong></p>

<p>Will win &ndash; <strong><em>Boyhood</em></strong></p>

<p>All the Best Picture nominees this year are about white males, directed by white males, except one. <em>Selma</em>, directed by an African-American female, Ava DuVernay, only has 2 nominations at the Oscars this year as a result of the movie finishing late, and the screeners not getting to voters in time for the guild awards, preventing it from gaining any momentum on the awards circuit. Oh and it is also <a href="http://grantland.com/features/selma-oscars-academy-awards-historical-accuracy-controversy/">being smeared</a> by anti-intellectuals for its portrayal of Lyndon B. Johnson.  The tone-deaf inanity of some people is infuriating.</p>

<p>The film is about the voting rights marches from Selma to Montegomery in 1965 led by MLK. It dives into the politics, strategy and practicality of the movement and it is never boring. The directing, dialogue, and cinematography is on point and David Oyelowo as MLK is on another level. On top of all that, it is the most important movie of last year in the wake of all the violence perpetrated against black people. There is a depressing irony of a movie about MLK being criticized of its portrayal of a white person. <em>Selma</em> was riveting, go watch it.</p>

<p>Not seen yet: Whiplash, Inherent Vice, Selma</p>

<h3>10 &ndash; Nightcrawler</h3>

<p>Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) reminds me of the many creeps I have come across in my life. He is a representation of the worst part of modern capitalism and what it breeds. <em>Nightcrawler</em> is the story of a hyperverbal, self-made, meticulous student of psychology who applies it to the world of L.A. crime journalism. Bloom&rsquo;s brilliance at manipulating his surroundings is mesmerizing. And his fierce dedication is both unnerving and enviable. We can only imagine where he will be in 20 years, <em>or</em> where today&rsquo;s CEOs were 20 years ago.</p>

<h3>9 &ndash; Snowpiercer</h3>

<p>Chris Evans, aka Captain America, stars in Joon-ho Bong&rsquo;s thriller, which takes place on a pyschedelic train circling a post-apocalyptic ice Earth. C&#8217;mon. You should probably go see it even if you don&rsquo;t care about the subtext I am about to explain. We tend to believe that our governing bodies are structured to make decisions for the &ldquo;greater good&rdquo;.  But when people are dissatisfied <strong>and</strong> think <em>they</em> know what is better for everyone, a revolution is born. But are all revolutionaries doomed to implement an essentially identical hierarchical system? In Egypt, Mubarak was ousted in a twitter-famous coup in 2011. In a matter of 2 years, his replacement Morsi, who got greedy with power, was also overthrown. Joon-ho Bong takes no issue with laying bare for his viewers the psychological brutality of revolution.</p>

<h3>8 &ndash; Interstellar</h3>

<p>Many great directors need to tackle their space-epic movie. Kubrick and <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>. Joss Whedon and <em>Serenity</em>. And Alfonso Cuaron&rsquo;s <em>Gravity</em>. Chris Nolan has held his weight with his entry into this tradition. First of all, it is a treat for people who love to untangle the complicated plotlines that movie&rsquo;s with time travel inevitably provide. It takes a considerable amount of mental energy to put all the pieces of this movie together, but it is so, so satisfying. As a bonus, this is a situation that you might actually learn things if you pay attention because Nolan spent an exhaustive amount of time discussing the science with actual physicists. The obligatory star-studded cast of actors in a Nolan movie is at the top of their game. Not to mention the awesome comedic relief robot sidekicks. And don&rsquo;t forget the brilliant visuals of space, wormholes, and Alberta, Canada. Sure it gets a little too sweet at the end, as Nolan is apt to do, but I think this time it was well-earned.</p>

<h3>7 &ndash; Edge Of Tomorrow</h3>

<p><em>Edge Of Tomorrow</em> features a criminally underrated performance by Tom  Cruise in the sci-fi Groundhog Day. The psychological effects of reliving a day endlessly are so fun to ponder. This film takes that idea very seriously and makes sure you feel deeply the frustration of repeatedly failing at figuring out how to &ldquo;win the day.&rdquo; This is all occurring in the middle of a futuristic war against a time-bending alien. For all the action films he&rsquo;s been in, you have never wanted Tom Cruise not-to-die more, than in this one.</p>

<h3>6 &ndash; The One I Love</h3>

<p>In my social circles, there have been a bevy of engagements. This has given me a lot of food for thought regarding what marriage means, why that is important, and oh-god-I&rsquo;m-going-to-die-alone. Mark Duplass (<em>The League</em>) and Elisabeth Moss (<em>Mad Men</em>) play a couple whose marriage is on the rocks and try to save it with a weekend getaway in a mysterious house. Once there, we are treated to one of the most fun sci-fi setups in a year filled with great sci-fi movies. It allows some of the questions of marriage to play out. What would you do to recapture that initial magic? What is it about a person that actually makes you want to stay? Moss and Duplass get into the messy, embarrassing, and immensely relatable feelings that we all have regarding the people close to us, and the expectations we stupidly place on them.</p>

<h3>5 &ndash; The LEGO Movie</h3>

<p>Movies are so ingrained in our psyche that we sometimes see ourselves as the star of our own life. Everyone else are just the extras. Phil Lord &amp; Chris Miller just go ahead and call it like it is; we all want to be the &ldquo;Special&rdquo; i.e. &ldquo;the most special, most talented, and most extraordinary person in the universe&rdquo;. Emmet (Chris Pratt) is thrown into a situation where this wish comes true, and everyone thinks he is the &ldquo;Special&rdquo;, who will save them all. But this movie is the anti-<em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>. In LEGO-land (sorry) blood tests don&rsquo;t reveal that we are actually unique at the end of the day. I, like Emmet, feel stupid compared to other people, am constantly encountering girls who already have a boyfriend, and would do almost anything for my friends. This movie resonates so well because it validates those everyday feelings. I haven&rsquo;t even mentioned that the twist belongs in the top 10 of all time, that it has a spot-on deconstruction of <a href="http://youtu.be/StTqXEQ2l-Y">modern pop music</a>, and a beautiful blend of CGI/stop-motion animation.</p>

<p><img src="http://cinemagogue.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/yGlBbZb.jpg"></p>

<h3>4 &ndash; Gone Girl</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to do away with withholding spoilers for this write-up. What I liked most about this movie is the character of Amy played by Rosamund Pike (At World&rsquo;s End). She is not a sociopath ala Lou Bloom in <em>Nightcrawler</em> when she frames her husband Nick (Ben Affleck) for her murder; she feels deeply. And she understands more than anyone in <em>The One I Love</em> about what matters in her marriage. Gillian Flynn (book &amp; screenwriter) and David Fincher have fun walking us through how she takes revenge on the person who stole away her potential. The visuals are the most stylish of Fincher&rsquo;s career yet and Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor (Nine Inch Nails) deliver an anxiety-inducing score. The unreal dramatics that drive this thrilling plot allow Amy and Nick&rsquo;s relationship to be dissected in the small glances, unreliable memories, and hurt feelings that compose a marriage.</p>

<p><img src="http://c.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/poster/2014/10/3036795-poster-p-1-gone-girl-sharp-objects-and-more-details.jpg"></p>

<h3>3 &ndash; Under The Skin</h3>

<p>This is ostensibly the year of Scarlett Johansson (<em>Lucy</em>, <em>Captain America 2</em>), whose acting talent is so often overshadowed by her sex appeal. Few actors of her status would go full-frontal for a relatively unknown director (Jonathon Glazer) on a movie that is part hidden camera reality show. We are thrown into the car of another nameless Driver, who scours the Scottish backroads picking up men, who are only later informed that it was only for the purposes of a movie. Devastating. The scenes depicting an alien adjust to life in a European town are incredibly poignant. The visual palette that Glazer uses is uniquely beautiful. This is a movie that you go see by yourself, that affixes you to the screen in awe.</p>

<p><img src="http://d1oi7t5trwfj5d.cloudfront.net/94/dc/837548e74bb8a722183beb291731/under-the-skin.jpg"></p>

<h3>2 &ndash; The Grand Budapest Hotel</h3>

<p>Who would have thought that the sweetest relationship on screen all year would be between a man and his lobby boy. Wes Anderson&rsquo;s newest paints a beautiful portrait, and I&rsquo;m not talking about Boy with Apple, of Zero Moustafa recounting his mentorship under the legendary concierge M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) at the eponymous hotel. If only we were all as lucky to have known this tremendous character. Absolutely loyal, insanely exacting, and completely self-aware.</p>

<blockquote><p>Mr. Moustafa: There are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity&hellip; He was one of them. What more is there to say?</p></blockquote>

<p><img src="http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1412046/thumbs/o-GRAND-BUDAPEST-HOTEL-TRAILER-facebook.jpg"></p>

<h3>1 &ndash; Boyhood</h3>

<blockquote><p>Mr.Turlington: Any dipshit can take pictures, Mason. Art, that&rsquo;s special. What can you bring to it that nobody else can?</p></blockquote>

<p>And that&rsquo;s what Richard Linklater does more consistently than any other filmmaker today. He brings it. Following actors growing up in real time is a unique achievement, but that&rsquo;s only half the picture. After all, Linklater did something similar with the Before Sunrise trilogy, filming Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy every 9 years. What elevates this movie to GOAT status is how effectively the real-time growth of the actors subtly shifted our perspective on the profound and the mundane moments of growing up. To reminisce on those early years is such sweet sorrow. And if all you girls are feeling left out, Linklater&rsquo;s own daughter plays Mason&rsquo;s sister Samantha, who this movie could easily have been about.</p>

<p>-I.I.</p>

<h2>The East</h2>




<p>1. Bulls (60-22) – I BELIEVE THAT WE WILL WIN. Rose’s Team USA performance induced a mild panic, as will every time he hits the floor. But in the preseason, we saw him shake off the rust and produce glimmers of his trademark explosiveness. But this team is not all about our returning PG. Pau Gasol is a solid upgrade on both defense and offense from Boozer to our starting 5. Though it will take time to find a place for him in the post with Noah and Gibson. And speaking of Taj, he will win sixth man this year, after being robbed last season. The concerns about scoring were addressed by bringing Mirotic over from Real Madrid and drafting Dougy McBuckets (aka Doug McDermott), the NCAA leader in scoring last year, and Kyle Korver 2.0 (both from Creighton!). The most important piece of this puzzle is Thibs. With possibly his best Bulls roster yet, he’ll be as irascible and demanding as ever on his way to the top of the Eastern conference.</p>




<p>2.  Cleveland Cavaliers (52-30)  - I’m heavily biased, but I do think there is this big of a gap between the Bulls and the rest of the Eastern Conference. The new Big 3 are going to need time to build chemistry. But in the dreadful eastern conference, they’ll get that chance by beating on less talented rosters. Outside of Love, Irving, and Bron-bron, the talent level drops significantly. At shooting guard are perennial sixth man Dion Waiters and Mike Miller, hardly inspiring. Varejao and Tristan Thompson at center are decent players, but they are a far cry from the Eastern Conference corps of elite centers - Noah, Bosh, pre-breakdown Hibbert, and Lopez. A lackluster bench and supporting crew are not a recipe for multiple championships&#8230; just look at the Spurs.</p>




<p>3.  Washington Wizards (49 – 33) – I had a hard time hating these guys when they outplayed my Bulls in the playoffs. Big men Nenê and Gortat play hard ball and will not let up easy points. Overall #1 pick John Wall is starting to play like it, leading the league in assists last year. I like these guys!</p>




<p>4.  Brooklyn Nets (45 - 37) – Don’t forget these ballers swept the Heat in the regular season last year. They had a rocky start til the All-Star break. Joe Johnson is a force on their offense, making Atlanta fan’s rue the day they traded him. But their old and might have hit their peak already.</p>




<p>5.  Toronto Raptors (44 - 38) – DeMar DeRozan blew up on the Raptors last year, averaging 22.7 points with a handful of rebounds and assists.  And let’s not forget Drake is dropping a new album this year. <a href="http://youtu.be/6IdmyC6WnXI" target="_blank">Just keep him off the court</a>.</p>




<p>6.  New York Knicks  (43 - 41) – Jackson and Fisher’s triangle offense will be the story surrounding this team. With Stoudemire back at 100%, playing the low post in this scheme, his talent could finally be realized on the Knicks. Calderon is an underrated point guard, and along with Iman Shumpert, I have no doubt they will effectively run the offense.</p>




<p>7.  Miami Heat (38 – 46) – Wade, Bosh, and Deng are no small threat. Hopefully, Spoelstra will finally get the credit he deserves as a coach, when he takes a James-less team to the playoffs. Oh and they’ll be playing Lebron in the playoffs. Probably take the Cavs to a Game 7, before bowing out gracefully. This is just the kind of shit that happens to the King.</p>




<p>8.  Charlotte ~~Bobcats~~ Hornets (36 – 48) – These guys added Lance Stephenson in the offseason, with MJ granting free reign to his <a href="(http://youtu.be/Cz3wvCNnF98" target="_blank">weird-ass behavior</a>. They’ve got a core group of young guys in Kemba Walker, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, and Cody Zeller that will only keep getting better. Veteran Al Jefferson is back from plantar fasciitis, that hellish irritation, and will be holding down the defense.</p>




<p>9. Atlanta Hawks (33 – 51) - Perennially in the barely made/missed the playoffs spot.</p>




<p>10. Boston Celtics (31—53) – As long as Rondo doesn’t get traded mid-season.</p>




<p>11. Detroit Pistons (29 – 51)</p>




<p>12. Indiana Pacers (27 – 53) - Pour one out for Paul George.</p>




<p>13. Orlando Magic (23 – 59)</p>




<p>14. Milwaukee Bucks (20 – 62)</p>




<p>15. Philadelphia 76ers (17 – 65) - Tank City</p>




<hr/>




<h2>The West</h2>


<p><img src="http://cdn.fansided.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/246/files/2013/11/7827526.jpg" /></p>

<p>1.  San Antonio (58 - 24) - What&#8217;s left to say about this team, this franchise, this coach, and his key pieces? They play team ball better than most. They&#8217;ll win what&#8217;s theirs. Let&#8217;s see what&#8217;s in the tank come the playoffs.</p>




<p>1.  Golden State (58 - 24) - David Lee is an underrated star. Though I&#8217;d like to think otherwise, Klay Thompson&#8217;s max contract is ludicrous. He would have taken the hometown discount, right? If this team is going to win, it has to win now. That&#8217;s why I think the Lee-Thompson-Currey does just that: wins now. I see no issue with the Warriors taking over the OKC slot and wrapping the season in the 2nd or 3rd seed.</p>




<p>3.  Houston (50 - 32) - Unlike other American sports leagues, in the NBA there&#8217;s a concept called &#8220;winning the offseason&#8221;. Every, single, offseason. The LeBron / Melo / Love / Garnett / whomever &#8220;sweepstakes&#8221;. This offseason, we had Bosh courting suitors. And while the Cavs dominated the offseason, the Rockets pulled a diametric opposite. No LeBron, and then when Bosh was in their sights&#8230; no Bosh. That said, they still have two of the top ten players in the league, including arguably the best, most diva-licious center around (sorry, Joakim). I like them in the regular season. We&#8217;ll see how they fare otherwise.</p>




<p>4.  Memphis (49 - 33)</p>




<p>5.  LA Clippers (47 - 35) - Quite the divisive team. Some folks think they hit a peak last year; some folks think they&#8217;re just getting started. You&#8217;re not gonna like this Logesh, but I tend to side with the former.</p>




<p>6.  Portland (46 - 36) - Rising superpower might be an overstatement, but there&#8217;s no lack of power on this team. I really like Lopez (the quiet, non-Net one) last year, posting some of his best numbers of his career. Plus, who doesn&#8217;t like Lillard&#8217;s upside? He&#8217;s a point guard that doesn&#8217;t take over a game, but doesn&#8217;t mean he couldn&#8217;t. He&#8217;ll post 7 APG and 20 PPG.</p>




<p>7.  Dallas (44 - 38)</p>




<p>7.  Oklahoma City (44 - 38) - Oh boy. Hindsight is 50-50, my friend, and at this rate, might be their win-loss percentage. Their schedule is inherently brutal, and now they&#8217;re missing their two key pieces. The identity of the team is shattered. Do they make the playoffs? I&#8217;ll give them an edge. I like Ibaka, and feel like their set piece players are enough to hold them over against the nadir of the Western conference (read: several Timberwolves and Lakers games).  Where they go from there is up to the team doctors.</p>




<p>9.  Phoenix (42 - 40)</p>




<p>10.  New Orleans (41 - 41) - Time for the &#8216;Brow to take over&#8230; at least half their games.</p>




<p>11.  Denver (37 - 45) - It hurts me to write about this team, who two years ago had the coach of the year and several fantastic players. I witnessed Iguodala hit a game-winner live against the high-flying Thunder. But now he&#8217;s a Warrior, and only Faried gives me hope.</p>




<p>12.  Sacramento (28 - 54) - Bleh.</p>




<p>13.  Minnesota (27 - 55) - No comment.</p>




<p>14.  Utah (20 - 62)</p>




<p>15.  LA Lakers (0 - 82) - alrightfineI&#8217;mkidding. But do they have anyone on their team that plays defense? No. A 36-year-old off-an-injury Kobe is still technically a Kobe, but the Lakers are in full rebuilding mode. And last night he hit a career low with a bazillion missed shots. He can&#8217;t carry this team. Let&#8217;s hope they can cash in that lottery ticket. </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When writing a Rails app, you&rsquo;ll almost always have to employ some form of user authorization. Peeps wanna be able to sign in and see their personal awesomeness. And often enough, certain folks (admins, managers, <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-W303-_EO37M/TVw1bxG_gRI/AAAAAAAAAjY/cjHl5LiOe3c/s1600/math2.jpg" target="_blank">bad-ass M.C.s</a>) will have specialized permissions. Today, we&rsquo;re going to hand roll authorization into our web app.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Popular Ruby gems for authorization include <a href="https://github.com/ryanb/cancan" target="_blank">CanCan</a>, <a href="https://github.com/RolifyCommunity/rolify" target="_blank">Rolify</a>, and my personal favorite, <a href="https://github.com/elabs/pundit" target="_blank">Pundit</a>. For the purposes of this walkthrough, we&rsquo;ll take some naming cues from the latter.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to assume you&rsquo;ve already handled authentication somewhere in your app. For clarity, authentication is confirming the identity of a user, while authorization is determining the permissions of said user.</p>

<h3>The Task at Hand</h3>


<p>Let&rsquo;s say our app, I don&rsquo;t know, <a href="http://www.github.com/gschorkopf/frolfr/" target="_blank">keeps track of disc golf scorecards</a>. Each scorecard has many (usually 18) &ldquo;turns&rdquo;, which is an object that contains the number of shots and par for a given hole on a given course. Let&rsquo;s say the object looks something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="c1"># db/schema.rb</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">create_table</span> <span class="s2">&quot;turns&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">force</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kp">true</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">|</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">integer</span>  <span class="s2">&quot;user_id&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">integer</span>  <span class="s2">&quot;hole_id&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">integer</span>  <span class="s2">&quot;score&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">integer</span>  <span class="s2">&quot;par&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">default</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>For our first task, let&rsquo;s say we only want the turn&rsquo;s player (user) to be able to <i>update</i> their own score / par / etc.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get to work.</p>

<h3>Writing a Turn Policy Object</h3>


<p>As my buddy <a href="https://twitter.com/srbiv" target="_blank">Stafford</a> says, &ldquo;naming things is the hardest thing we do in programming.&rdquo; The key to building out good authorization is writing an understandable policy object.</p>

<p>In the thoughtful Pundit library, a policy object&rsquo;s method and class titles closely mirror the naming of Rails&#8217; RESTful resources and model conventions, respectfully.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s test drive this shiz.</p>

</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Simple enough! The spec creates a mock current user (the signed in user), a mock other user, and a mock turn. It tests that the current user can update a turn. That&rsquo;s all we really need to get started.</p>

<p>When building out the TurnPolicy class, I like to use Structs. They&rsquo;re simple, and we&rsquo;re looking for simplicity here.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="c1"># app/policies/turn_policy.rb</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">TurnPolicy</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">Struct</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:current_user</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:turn</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Note the naming: the class <code>TurnPolicy</code> mirrors the <code>Turn</code> model. We place the policy in a policies directory, and pass it our current user (which you will for any policy object you create) and a turn variable. Lovely.</p>

<p>Next, we&rsquo;ll need to build out an <code>update?</code> method. As you might have guessed based on the name, this can be used in many places: our <code>TurnsController#update</code> action, our turns&#8217; edit page, and anywhere else it&rsquo;s needed. Neat, eh?</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="c1"># app/policies/turn_policy.rb</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">TurnPolicy</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">Struct</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:current_user</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:turn</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">update?</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Tada! Now let&rsquo;s apply our <code>update?</code> method elsewhere.</p>

<hr/>




<h3>Applying our Object to Requests</h3>


<p>This is what our turn&rsquo;s update action looks like now:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="c1"># app/controllers/turns_controller.rb</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">TurnsController</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ApplicationController</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">update</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="vi">@turn</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Turn</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">params</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:id</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="c1"># Do the updating</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now we need to raise some sort of error when a bad user attempts to reach this action. Let&rsquo;s make the error reuseable across all our controllers and put it in our ApplicationController. The error can be anything, as long as it prevents the user from doing any updating.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="c1"># app/controllers/application_controller.rb</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">ApplicationController</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="ss">ActionController</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="ss">:Base</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c1"># ...</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">authorize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">policy</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">raise</span> <span class="no">KaboomError</span> <span class="k">unless</span> <span class="n">policy</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So we&rsquo;ve passed a method called <code>authorize</code> a boolean value, called <code>policy</code>. If the turn belongs to the user, all is well &mdash; otherwise &mdash; &ldquo;KABOOM.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s put this method to work.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="c1"># app/controllers/turns_controller.rb</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">TurnsController</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ApplicationController</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c1"># ...</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">update</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="vi">@turn</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Turn</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">params</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:id</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">authorize</span> <span class="n">policy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">turn</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">update?</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="c1"># Do the updating</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">policy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">turn</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="no">TurnPolicy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">current_user</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">turn</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We define our policy in a new method. We then use the <code>authorize</code> method and our <code>update?</code> method to authorize the action.</p>

<hr/>




<h3>Applying our Object to Views</h3>


<p>Finally, let&rsquo;s say we have a scorecard page, which is also our turns#index action. It&rsquo;s a simple table with all turns for that scorecard, as well as the ability to edit any score in place. Any user can view the scorecard; it&rsquo;s public. But only the turn&rsquo;s owner can edit a turn. In our TurnsController, we can turn our <code>policy</code> method into a nifty helper method.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="c1"># app/controllers/turns_controller.rb</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">TurnsController</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ApplicationController</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c1"># ...</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">helper_method</span> <span class="ss">:policy</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">policy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">turn</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="no">TurnPolicy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">current_user</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">turn</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So our view would could now something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="c1"># app/views/turns/index.html.slim</span>

</span><span class='line'>        <span class="n">td</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">link_to</span> <span class="n">turn</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">score</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">turn_path</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">turn</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="o">-</span> <span class="k">else</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="n">td</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">turn</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">score</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We have a simple conditional that links to the turn page, or simply shows the turn&rsquo;s score.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>


<p>Hand rolling your own tools can remove dependencies, allows programmers unfamiliar with certain libraries to check out the policies within your own source code, and is just fun to try out.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://four-point-play.herokuapp.com/images/lance.png" title="Lance Acting a Clown" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>Herein lies my quick thoughts on the pathetic Indiana Pacers team, and why I need them to lose game 6 to enjoy watching the rest of the playoffs.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I grew up without much of a sporting interest in basketball, let alone a rooting interest in my home-town Nets and Knicks; ergo, my passion for the sport extends to a love of most teams, and a general appreciation for fundamental, tough, skilled basketball.</p>

<p>In short: I want the clown car that drops the Pacers team off at American Airlines arena tomorrow to blow a tire and go careening off into South Beach. I need this bush-league playoff run to end.</p>

<p>I wanted it to end against the Hawks. I expected it to end against the Wizards. And now I <strong>need</strong> it to end against the Heat. Here&rsquo;s why.</p>

<p><b>The driver of the clown car: Frank Vogel.</b> It&rsquo;s hard to watch, frankly. This is what I mean by pathetic &ndash; pathos. I feel bad for the guy. He&rsquo;s in way over his head, and is barely keeping the show on the road. When George, Hibbert, and Stephenson talk to the media or fall apart on the court, it&rsquo;s clearly a reflection on the coach, his style, and the respect he commands.</p>

<p><b>Paul George&rsquo;s immaturity.</b> His 31 in the second half of game 5 was great. Does anyone expect him to repeat that? He&rsquo;s been hailed as a superstar this year. He&rsquo;s not. He&rsquo;s been hailed as their centerpiece, but he hardly brings the playoff room together. And his childish comments that the &ldquo;refs affected game 4&rsquo;s outcome&rdquo;? Did the refs blow you out by 12 points in a game that was never even that close? No. That was the Heat.</p>

<p><b>Lance Stephenson&rsquo;s trash talk.</b> Really? You&rsquo;re going to sit there as the &ldquo;occasionally 3rd best player&rdquo; on a team and try to get in the best player <b>in the league&rsquo;s</b> head? Two losses later I thought he&rsquo;d back down. But no: in game 5 he <b>blew in James&#8217; ear before a foul shot</b> and then <b>tried to listen in on a Heat huddle</b>. I know some basketball players didn&rsquo;t go to college, but surely y&#8217;all have graduated middle school, the very <b>last</b> time that stunt was socially acceptable. At least you&rsquo;ve inspired some great <a href="http://espn.go.com/sportsnation/post/_/id/11001550/lance-stephenson-blows-lebron-ear-sparks-funny-memes">memes</a>, Lance.</p>

<p>In short: finish &lsquo;em off, Heat. The first-seed Pacers are barely the sixth seed in Western Conference. Their brash childishness must be stopped. I&rsquo;d hate to watch a Pacers-versus <b>anyone</b> final. If they&rsquo;re going to act petulant, play out-of-their-league, and frankly be painful-to-watch, count me out. That&rsquo;s just the basketball fan in me.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Part 1 in I.I. and GPS&rsquo;s series on the NBA Conference Finals. We talk about whether the Heat should worry, Scotty Brook&rsquo;s tough decision, and Charles Barkley actin&#8217; a fool.</p>

<!--more-->


<p><strong>I.I.</strong>: The match-ups are set! On both sides the top two seeds are squaring off. A bipolar Pacers team stumbled to the conference finals against the Eastern conference favorite Heat. The MVP-led Thunder, minus Serge Ibaka, will take on Popovich&rsquo;s Spurs. So GeoSpec, what are your thoughts?</p>

<p>Will the Thunder&rsquo;s young guns wear out a veteran Spurs team that closed out the series against Portland with their bench? Will the Pacers surprise us by taking a couple games on the road against the Heat, as they are apt to do? And what about the big &lsquo;ol woman down in San Antonio? Will they come to some sort of truce with Charles Barkley?</p>

<p><strong>GPS</strong>: These are the match ups everyone wanted, right? A rematch of last year&rsquo;s Eastern Conference Finals, and a likely (sorry, Pacers) rematch of either the 2012 or 2013 NBA finals upcoming. Let&rsquo;s break it down. We&rsquo;ll pose some questions, we&rsquo;ll both give our take. Boom:</p>

<h4>Should the Heat be worried after dropping game 1 to the inconsistent Pacers?</h4>


<p><strong>GPS</strong>: I hate to say it: yes. But maybe not for the reasons you&rsquo;d think. It&rsquo;s really more about the Heat than the Pacers. The Heat have been coasting on production from LeBron and an occasional set piece (mostly Allen) for two series now. Where has Bosh been? Will the Heat&rsquo;s lack of size pose another problem? What about that game 7 home court advantage? Can they get another 81% shooting rampage from someone like Chris Andersen (2013)? These are all concerns. The Heat can win on the road. They have this year, and did last year against these same Pacers. But they&rsquo;re concerns regardless. The Pacers have been shaky, sure, and I still can&rsquo;t see them winning the series; but for whatever reason, the Pacers play significantly harder against the Heat.</p>

<p><strong>I.I.</strong>: You know, you&rsquo;re the second person today to tell me they can see the schizophrenic Pacers winning this series. If they end up in the Finals, I envision a sweep at the hands of the Spurs. The only entertaining part of that series would be Popovich coaching against his former protégé George Hill. The Pacers won 3 of their 4 against the Wizards on the road. Without much home court advantage on either side, I can see this series alternating until a Heat blowout in Game 7 at Indiana. Indiana&rsquo;s got size, but if Bosh and Chalmers start to pick it up, and Battier and Allen sink clutch 3s like they&rsquo;re paid to do, it will be hard for Paul George &amp; crew to keep up.</p>

<h4>What do you make of the Spurs shutting down the Thunder in Game 1?</h4>


<p><strong>I.I.</strong>: I don&rsquo;t envy the decisions Scotty Brooks has to make right now. I would hedge my bets on the side of sticking to small ball to match the firepower of the Spurs, which was how they overcame the Clippers. It was inexcusable for 2 OKC starters to put up goose eggs, and that&rsquo;s certainly going to change. But they miss Ibaka&rsquo;s offense because the smaller Reggie Jackson and Caron Butler are clearly overmatched against the defense of Splitter and Diaw.  Going big would require Durant and Westbrook to carry the offense, which, if the emotions are there, they do for two games tops.  The Thunder are not out of this by a long shot, having lost their last four road Game 1s, but it&rsquo;s not good to be lucky that you were only down 8 at the half. Also, the Spurs a whopping +30 with Danny Green on the floor, whaaaat.</p>

<p><strong>GPS</strong>: The Thunder might be missing Ibaka already. Any Spur could get to the rim at will in game 1. I can only imagine that continuing in game 2. The Spurs outscored the Thunder 66 to 32 in the paint. I couldn&rsquo;t believe that stat when I saw it.  Clearly playing small backfired for Scott Brooks. They&rsquo;ll have to get someone to replace Ibaka, or this series could turn ugly.</p>

<h4>Who do you have in Game 2 of each series?</h4>


<p><strong>GPS</strong>: Heat. I just don&rsquo;t believe the Pacers can win two in a row. They couldn&rsquo;t against the Hawks. They won&rsquo;t against the Heat. They&rsquo;re 4 and 4 at home this season, and can&rsquo;t imagine the Heat allowing 30 in another first quarter, as they did in a miserable game 1 showing.</p>

<p><strong>I.I.</strong>: Heat, with Bosh having a monster game and Lance Stephenson going 2 for 10. I&rsquo;m thinking the Spurs are gonna put another beatdown on OKC. I think the Thunder&rsquo;s coaching staff needs another game to figure out what to do against these guys. Maybe pull in some of those big ol&#8217; women down in San Antonio to crowd the paint.</p>

    <updated>2014-05-15T13:39:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://four-point-play.herokuapp.com/blog/2014/05/15/professionalism-in-medicine</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We are comporting ourselves in every situation, subconsciously considering our role, our expectations, the other parties’ expectations, and our prior experiences. In this coffee shop, I am a customer expecting quiet, because that is the unspoken pact I share with the afternoon crowd that frequents this place. I distinctly remember a philosophy course when I brought up how we are different people to different people, and a Laker purple-and-gold clad loudmouth was taken aback. She seemed to argue that it demonstrated purity to be the same to all people all the time. Maybe it is because we slip so effortlessly into these skins, that some people are unaware. A refusal to acknowledge this socially lubricating farce could underpin those stubborn people who can’t seem to get along with anyone. An inability to adapt can be a stressful way to live.</p>

<p><img src="http://four-point-play.herokuapp.com/images/comic1.jpg" title="Lola Versus" alt="alt text" /></p>

<!--more-->


<p>Many of our &ldquo;professional&rdquo; lives are a journey into learning the rules of how to behave in our workplace environs. How should I dress? What are the right things to do to make the boss see that I’m valuable? Should I be networking more? Some people find mentors whose habits they mimic to fit in better. It is an organic process, of how an individual integrates into a group.</p>

<p>So, professionalism is the attributes ascribed to a profession. It is gained as one transitions from being an amateur to going pro.  As a medical student about to enter his fourth and final year, at the conclusion of which people will start calling him and considering him “doctor”, it is of utmost concern.</p>

<p><img src="http://four-point-play.herokuapp.com/images/comic2.gif" title="Lola Versus" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>At the top of our end-of-rotation evaluations, the preceptor is asked if the student exhibited professionalism. If the answer is no, nothing else matters, you’re retaking the rotation. And so daily, we student doctors fret over how we can best exude professionalism. The syllabus requires wearing a tie for males. But, save for the occasional hospital administrator/CEO, the med student is the best dressed person in a hospital of assumedly unprofessional slobs. Short white coats must be worn at all times. Aside from this being inexcusable as a proven infection-transmitting nidus, it doesn’t even convey your role anymore. Everyone from the social worker to the pharmacist now rocks the off-white coat.</p>

<p>What about learning professionalism from our superiors, the godly attending physicians whose shoes we will one day fill? In this hierarchical profession, they berate us for not being able to read their minds on how they want a patient presented. They knowingly grill us on the minutiae of some piece of medical knowledge, indignant when we fumble the answer. If they don’t treat the lowly students with respect, they surely wouldn’t be so cavalier with their patients. As you&rsquo;ve surely experienced, it is uncommon to be in a room where the doc spends more time looking at the patient than at a computer screen or chart. Unfortunately, an academic single-mindedness can thrive in this field. Empathy and rapport-building skills are never assessed for entry into medical school or residency.</p>

<p>The true essence of professionalism in medicine is the doctor who respects and treats a patient’s medical and psychological concerns. Most docs can process clinical signs, symptoms, and lab data to prescribe the recommended treatment. Magic medicine delivered through an IV does little to assuage the worry that wracks anyone inside the medical system juggernaut.  I did an experiment where I either introduced myself as a medical student or an undergraduate at my school’s health center. You might think that in the former, I received special treatment like a native in an ethnic restaurant. But, the fact mattered little. I felt like little more than an obstacle in their workflow, despite my attempts at forming  a connection by asking about their day, family, etc. I am guilty of this too. My main concern is often to get in and out of a room as quickly as I can so I can write my note and go home early.</p>

<p><img src="http://four-point-play.herokuapp.com/images/comic3.gif" title="Lola Versus" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>One afternoon, my faculty mentor came by the hospital and showed me how a real pro does it. Unabashedly, he started with non-sequitur icebreakers like it was summer camp, instead of the scripted, remote “What brings you to the hospital/clinic/ER today?” And he pushes for answers.</p>

<blockquote><p>“I dunno…”</p>

<p>“Come on there must be something you like doing in your free time?”</p>

<p>“I guess I really enjoy playing with my 4yo daughter.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Suddenly, a particularly obstinate pain patient wasn’t feeling too bad anymore.</p>

<p>Medical professionalism is the relationship we are able to develop with our patients and our coworkers. It goes beyond making someone else feel warm &amp; fuzzy. In this field, a person’s healthy and vitality, and sometimes life or limb, is on the line. What matters most is being able to trust a patient’s testimony, them reciprocating the trust by allowing us to intervene, and the team trusting each other to get the job done quickly and correctly. While we are assessed by our starched white coats and biohazard neck ties, shouldn&rsquo;t some consideration be given to the professionalism that is demonstrated by treating a patient as more than a disease process? With little emphasis on its teaching, a paucity of mentors, and an overburdened healthcare system, the professional doctor, like the do-it-all family doc, might become a relic of the past.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You&rsquo;ve probably heard the phrase &ldquo;fat models, skinny controllers&rdquo; before. The misconception of &ldquo;fat models&rdquo;: that it&rsquo;s okay for models to be very large and unwieldy. But when Rails models become a dumping ground for all things even tangentially related to the original class, it&rsquo;s probably time to trim off a few pounds.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>One way to do that is to pare away complex validations. For example, you might think it wise to drum up a method or two to handle passwords (minimum 8 characters! minimum one number! no weird symbols! etc.) So you throw these methods into the private domain of your User class, and call it a day. But you can (and should) probably move that logic elsewhere.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with what not to do:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And that&rsquo;s fine. It works. But is password complexity really the User&rsquo;s responsibilty? What if you had an Admin or Account or Enterprise model that required some sort of password? Surely you wouldn&rsquo;t <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself">duplicate</a> your efforts there?</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s simplify our User model down to this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="c1"># app/models/user.rb</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">User</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="ss">ActiveRecord</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="ss">:Base</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Wow. Such elegant. Very simplicity. <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/doge">Amaze.</a></p>

<p>But how does this <code>complexity: true</code> work? Behind the scenes, we hide away that original logic that&rsquo;s not even really related to a User. You can inherit from the ActiveModel::EachValidator class, like so:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>There&rsquo;s a bit of Rails magic here. The &ldquo;Complexity&rdquo; title knows to create a complexity argument. Recall the User model line:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">validates</span> <span class="ss">:password</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">complexity</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kp">true</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It&rsquo;s as easy as that!</p>

<p>And to tidy things up on the view end, consider the following for error handling:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Director: Daryl Wein<br/>
Runtime: 87 minutes<br/>
Cast: Greta Gerwig, Hamish Linklater, Zoe Lister-Jones<br/></p>

<!--more-->


<p>This hidden gem has been lying on my coffee table for two months after I picked it up for under five bucks at my local video store. It was part of a double feature purchase which also included Evil Dead, to be reviewed shortly. The sole reason it caught my eye was because of Ms. Gerwig’s mesmerizing performance as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Ha">Frances Ha</a>’s titular heroine in one of the best movies of 2012. Director and co-writer Noah Baumbach left his wife and child during this collaboration, so it’s not just me that is caught in her magnetic field. And she will go on to reboot the How I Met Your Mother franchise by drudging through the story of HSMHH in HIMYD. HIMYM is one of my favorite sitcoms,  dare I say the Friends of my generation, and it has been endlessly renewed past its expiration date. Part of the reason, I presume, the finale felt so foreign to many viewers. My opinion, I loved how they ended things. But, it does a lot to sooth my anxieites that this spinoff will be anchored by this capable, indie star.</p>

<p>Before all her recent success, this film showcased her remarkable talent. It centers around the year between her 29th and 30th birthday, no small time in anyone’s life. She is joined in NYC by romantic interest Luke (Joel Kinnaman), best friend Alice (Zoe Lister Jones), and male-best-friend-who-obviously-has-a-crush-on-her Henry (Hamish Linklater!). You&rsquo;ve watched enough romantic comedies to know where this is going. She ends up with the more compatible best friend after making a few mistakes along the way. The writers refreshingly barrel through plot points to arrive at that ending halfway through the movie. This would not have worked without the splendid ability of these actors to develop a quick, believable chemistry. The relationships are strained mainly due to the reluctance of these characters to communicate, all coming to culmination in a nervous breakdown. The strength of this film comes on the comedic half of its pursuits. The dialogue is clever and fresh, helped tremendously by the delivery of Gerwig and crew. Pay attention to the set pieces too, if you&rsquo;ve ever wondered what a happenstance prison architect has on his walls. If you like to complain about how Hollywood can&rsquo;t make a comedic film with female leads, check this one out.</p>

<p>While we get some fun situations in the story of Lola dealing with the stresses of her romantic life, I am left wondering why she constantly befuddles her own attempts at growth. It seems to be assumed that this how women her age in this culture deal with life. Her stagnation turns quickly into frustration for the viewer who has learned the lessons that romantic comedies have to teach us. &ldquo;You’re making all the classic mistakes!&rdquo;, you want to yell at the hapless girl. Her parents&#8217; sage advice is the proxy for the omniscient viewer, which Lola promptly ignores in the scenes after they disappear. As she showed in the far superior, Frances Ha, which revolves around the same topics, one can mine the depths of the relationships between friends and lovers, while still being funny. I am scared that CBS execs saw this movie and thought that we could get Greta Gerwig easily drag out her romantic growth through 9 seasons as she did through this hour-and-a-half movie. It is a waste of her talent, but good exploitation of her appeal.</p>
