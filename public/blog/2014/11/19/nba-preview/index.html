<h2>The East</h2>




<p>1. Bulls (60-22) – I BELIEVE THAT WE WILL WIN. Rose’s Team USA performance induced a mild panic, as will every time he hits the floor. But in the preseason, we saw him shake off the rust and prodce glimmers of his trademark explosiveness. But this team is not all about our returning PG. Pau Gasol is a solid upgrade on both defense and offense from Boozer to our starting 5. Though it will take time to find a place for him in the post with Noah and Gibson. And speaking of Taj, he will win sixth man this year, after being robbed last season. The concerns about scoring were addressed by bringing Mirotic over from Real Madrid and drafting Dougy McBuckets (aka Doug McDermott), the NCAA leader in scoring last year, and Kyle Korver 2.0 (both from Creighton!). The most important piece of this puzzle is Thibs. With possibly his best Bulls roster yet, he’ll be as irascible and demanding as ever on his way to the top of the Eastern conference.</p>




<p>2.  Cleveland Cavaliers (52-30)  - I’m heavily biased, but I do think there is this big of a gap between the Bulls and the rest of the Eastern Conference. The new Big 3 are going to need time to build chemistry. But in the dreadful eastern conference, they’ll get that chance by beating on less talented rosters. Outside of Love, Irving, and Bron-bron, the talent level drops significantly. At shooting guard are perennial sixth man Dion Waiters and Mike Miller, hardly inspiring. Varejao and Tristan Thompson at center are decent players, but they are a far cry from the Eastern Conferece corps of elite centers - Noah, Bosh, pre-breakdown Hibbert, and Lopez. A lackluster bench and supporting crew are not a recipe for multiple championships&#8230; just look at the Spurs.</p>




<p>3.  Washington Wizards (49 – 33) – I had a hard time hating these guys when they outplayed my Bulls in the playoffs. Big men Nenê and Gortat play hard ball and will not let up easy points. Overall #1 pick John Wall is starting to play like it, leading the league in assists last year. I like these guys!</p>




<p>4.  Brooklyn Nets (45 - 37) – Don’t forget these ballers swept the Heat in the regular season last year. They had a rocky start til the All-Star break. Joe Johnson is a force on their offense, making Atlanta fan’s rue the day they traded him. But their old and might have hit their peak already.</p>




<p>5.  Toronto Raptors (44 - 38) – DeMar DeRozan blew up on the Raptors last year, averaging 22.7 points with a handful of rebounds and assists.  And let’s not forget Drake is dropping a new album this year. <a href="http://youtu.be/6IdmyC6WnXI" target="_blank">Just keep him off the court</a>.</p>




<p>6.  New York Knicks  (43 - 41) – Jackson and Fisher’s triangle offense will be the story surrounding this team. With Stoudemire back at 100%, playing the low post in this scheme, his talent could finally be realized on the Knicks. Calderon is an underrated point guard, and along with Iman Shumpert, I have no doubt they will effectively run the offense.</p>




<p>7.  Miami Heat (38 – 46) – Wade, Bosh, and Deng are no small threat. Hopefully, Spoelstra will finally get the credit he deserves as a coach, when he takes a James-less team to the playoffs. Oh and they’ll be playing Lebron in the playoffs. Probably take the Cavs to a Game 7, before bowing out gracefully. This is just the kind of shit that happens to the King.</p>




<p>8.  Charlotte ~~Bobcats~~ Hornets (36 – 48) – These guys added Lance Stephenson in the offseason, with MJ granting free reign to his <a href="(http://youtu.be/Cz3wvCNnF98" target="_blank">weird-ass behavior</a>. They’ve got a core group of young guys in Kemba Walker, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, and Cody Zeller that will only keep getting better. Veteran Al Jefferson is back from plantar fasciitis, that hellish irritation, and will be holding down the defense.</p>




<p>9. Atlanta Hawks (33 – 51) - Perenially in the barely made/missed the playoffs spot.</p>




<p>10. Boston Celtics (31—53) – As long as Rondo doesn’t get traded mid-season.</p>




<p>11. Detroit Pistons (29 – 51)</p>




<p>12. Indiana Pacers (27 – 53) - Pour one out for Paul George.</p>




<p>13. Orlando Magic (23 – 59)</p>




<p>14. Milwaukee Bucks (20 – 62)</p>




<p>15. Philladelphia 76ers (17 – 65) - Tank City</p>

<h2>The West</h2>


<p><img src="http://cdn.fansided.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/246/files/2013/11/7827526.jpg" /></p>

<p>1.  San Antonio (58 - 24) - What&#8217;s left to say about this team, this franchise, this coach, and his key pieces? They play team ball better than most. They&#8217;ll win what&#8217;s theirs. Let&#8217;s see what&#8217;s in the tank come the playoffs.</p>




<p>1.  Golden State (58 - 24) - David Lee is an underrated star. Though I&#8217;d like to think otherwise, Klay Thompson&#8217;s max contract is ludicrous. He would have taken the home town discount, right? If this team is going to win, it has to win now. That&#8217;s why I think the Lee-Thompson-Currey does just that: wins now. I see no issue with the Warriors taking over the OKC slot and wrapping the season in the 2nd or 3rd seed.</p>




<p>3.  Houston (50 - 32) - Unlike other American sports leagues, in the NBA there&#8217;s a concept called &#8220;winning the offseason&#8221;. Every, single, offseason. The LeBron / Melo / Love / Garnett / whomever &#8220;sweepstakes&#8221;. This offseason, we had Bosh courting suitors. And while the Cavs dominated the offseason, the Rockets pulled a diametric opposite. No LeBron, and then when Bosh was in their sights&#8230; no Bosh. That said, they still have two of the top ten players in the league, including arguably the best, most diva-licious center around (sorry, Joakim). I like them in the regular season. We&#8217;ll see how they fare otherwise.</p>




<p>4.  Memphis (49 - 33)</p>




<p>5.  LA Clippers (47 - 35) - Quite the divisive team. Some folks think they hit a peak last year; some folks think they&#8217;re just getting started. You&#8217;re not gonna like this Logesh, but I tend to side with the former.</p>




<p>6.  Portland (46 - 36) - Rising superpower might be an overstatement, but there&#8217;s no lack of power on this team. I really like Lopez (the quiet, non-Net one) last year, posting some of his best numbers of his career. Plus, who doesn&#8217;t like Lillard&#8217;s upside? He&#8217;s a point guard that doesn&#8217;t take over a game, but doesn&#8217;t mean he couldn&#8217;t. He&#8217;ll post 7 APG and 20 PPG.</p>




<p>7.  Dallas (44 - 38)</p>




<p>7.  Oklahoma City (44 - 38) - Oh boy. Hindsight is 50-50, my friend, and at this rate, might be their win-loss percentage. Their schedule is inherently brutal, and now they&#8217;re missing their two key pieces. The identity of the team is shattered. Do they make the playoffs? I&#8217;ll give them an edge. I like Ibaka, and feel like their set piece players are enough to hold them over against the nadir of the Western conference (read: several Timberwolves and Lakers games).  Where they go from there is up to the team doctors.</p>




<p>9.  Phoenix (42 - 40)</p>




<p>10.  New Orleans (41 - 41) - Time for the &#8216;Brow to take over&#8230; at least half their games.</p>




<p>11.  Denver (37 - 45) - It hurts me to write about this team, who two years ago had the coach of the year and several fantastic players. I witnessed Iguodala hit a game-winner live against the high-flying Thunder. But now he&#8217;s a Warrior, and only Faried gives me hope.</p>




<p>12.  Sacramento (28 - 54) - Bleh.</p>




<p>13.  Minnesota (27 - 55) - No comment.</p>




<p>14.  Utah (20 - 62)</p>




<p>15.  LA Lakers (0 - 82) - alrightfineI&#8217;mkidding. But do they have anyone on their team that plays defense? No. A 36-year-old off-an-injury Kobe is still technically a Kobe, but the Lakers are in full rebuilding mode. And last night he hit a career low with a bazillion missed shots. He can&#8217;t carry this team. Let&#8217;s hope they can cash in that lottery ticket. </p>
