<p>Herein lies my quick thoughts on the pathetic Indiana Pacers team, and why I need them to lose game 6 to enjoy watching the rest of the playoffs.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I grew up without much of a sporting interest in basketball, let alone a rooting interest in my home-town Nets and Knicks; ergo, my passion for the sport extends to a love of most teams, and a general appreciation for fundamental, tough, skilled basketball.</p>

<p>In short: I want the clown car that drops the Pacers team off at American Airlines arena tomorrow to blow a tire and go careening off into South Beach. I need this bush-league playoff run to end.</p>

<p>I wanted it to end against the Hawks. I expected it to end against the Wizards. And now I <strong>need</strong> it to end against the Heat. Here&rsquo;s why.</p>

<p><b>The driver of the clown car: Frank Vogel.</b> It&rsquo;s hard to watch, frankly. This is what I mean by pathetic &ndash; pathos. I feel bad for the guy. He&rsquo;s in way over his head, and is barely keeping the show on the road. When George, Hibbert, and Stephenson talk to the media or fall apart on the court, it&rsquo;s clearly a reflection on the coach, his style, and the respect he commands.</p>

<p><b>Paul George&rsquo;s immaturity.</b> His 31 in the second half of game 5 was great. Does anyone expect him to repeat that? He&rsquo;s been hailed as a superstar this year. He&rsquo;s not. He&rsquo;s been hailed as their centerpiece, but he hardly brings the playoff room together. And his childish comments that the &ldquo;refs affected game 4&rsquo;s outcome&rdquo;? Did the refs blow you out by 12 points in a game that was never even that close? No. That was the Heat.</p>

<p><b>Lance Stephenson&rsquo;s trash talk.</b> Really? You&rsquo;re going to sit there as the &ldquo;occasionally 3rd best player&rdquo; on a team and try to get in the best player <b>in the league&rsquo;s</b> head? Two losses later I thought he&rsquo;d back down. But no: in game 5 he <b>blew in James&#8217; ear before a foul shot</b> and then <b>tried to listen in on a Heat huddle</b>. I know some basketball players didn&rsquo;t go to college, but surely y&#8217;all have graduated middle school, the very <b>last</b> time that stunt was socially acceptable. At least you&rsquo;ve inspired some great <a href="http://espn.go.com/sportsnation/post/_/id/11001550/lance-stephenson-blows-lebron-ear-sparks-funny-memes">memes</a>, Lance.</p>

<p>In short: finish &lsquo;em off, Heat. The first-seed Pacers are barely the sixth seed in Western Conference. Their brash childishness must be stopped. I&rsquo;d hate to watch a Pacers-versus <b>anyone</b> final. If they&rsquo;re going to act petulant, play out-of-their-league, and frankly be painful-to-watch, count me out. That&rsquo;s just the basketball fan in me.</p>
